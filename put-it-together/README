Everything put together.

Previous phases fixes list:
Lexer:
- incorrectly lexing "function". DONE

Type-Checking:
- AssignExp should return UNIT type. DONE
- The value being assigned to and the value being assigned should be the same type. DONE
- The iteration variable in for-loops must be unassignable. TODO
- FieldVar is not always working. DONE
- Should not allow assigning to implicitlt typed variables. DONE

Intermediate Representation:
- Fix field var & subscript var. DONE
- Checking array bounds when translating subscript var. DONE
- Duplicate fragments when creating string literals that already exists. DONE
- String comparison requires external call. DONE
- When making function call, should append whether the static link escape. DONE
- Tracking size of array when creating them. DONE

Instruction Selection:
- Need to handle more than 4 arguments in munchArgs. DONE
- Need to handle moves from memory, label, or constant. DONE
- In CJUMP, no need to jump to the false label. DONE
- In munchExp, need to handle MEM(BINOP(MINUS,...)). DONE
